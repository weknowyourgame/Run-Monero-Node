# Run a Monero Node

> I believe in privacyâ€”especially financial privacy. Everyone has the right to control their own data, make transactions freely, and stay anonymous if they choose. Tools like Monero and Tor help make that a reality.

> Monero nodes validate and relay private transactions, keeping the blockchain updated. They ensure anonymity using ring signatures and stealth addresses. Some run over Tor using .onion addresses to enhance privacy and network anonymity.


### Why should i run a Monero Node
- If you do not run your own node, you are relying on other's nodes to verify and send your transactions
- Contribute to the decentralization of the Monero network
- To independently have the ability to send/receive/verify transactions while maintaining the highest privacy and security

### You can run 2 types of nodes
- Full Node: Stores all blockchain data
- Pruned Node: Stores a random 1/8th of the blockchain's data

### Minimum Requirements for Full Node
- Dual-core CPU
- 4+ GB RAM
- 160GB+ SSD HD

### Minimum Requirements for Pruned Node
- Dual-core CPU
- 4+ Gb RAM
- 80GB+ SSD HD
